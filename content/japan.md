Recently visited [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan). Stayed overnight at [a Buddhist temple](https://en.japantravel.com/hiroshima/fudoin-temple/4418n), partially ascended [Mount Misen](http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3451.html), and munched on [kushikatsu](https://tabelog.com/en/osaka/A2701/A270206/27000443/). Also ate unadon, chutoro and snacked on [baumkuchen](http://shun-gate.com/en/okurimono/confectioneries/okurimono_10.html) from [konbinis](https://www.buzzfeed.com/mjs538/strongs-for-everyone?utm_term=.qj8Q5AWxn#.hi7mVX82M).
